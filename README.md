# A7chat
This repo is the home for my chat bot. The bot is currently in its infancy and is being nurtured here.
It is linked through my website: blackvitriol.github.io

*Disclaimer*: This bot does not represent me, my ideas or thoughts, it is based on AIML.
It also gets trained by the conversation it has, so it might utter something that is not nice.

**Currently**
- AIML-based. Based on ALICE chatbot.
- Python 2.0 based Flask server.

**Future:**
- Represent self
- LSTM-RNN based Chatbot
- Setting up the architecture
- Training
